                        <h3> Healing the Cancer of Racism and Discrimination in Prairie Village </h3>
                        <p>by Dr. George Williams</p>
                        <p style="text-align: left"> Jesse Clyde (J.C.) Nichols was born in 1880 in the free state of Kansas. He transformed Kansas City by building the stunning Country Club Plaza and developing attractive tree-lined residential subdivisions where homes continue to appreciate in value nearly a century later. But for decades, Nichols perpetuated the ugly cancer of racism and discrimination that has had a long lasting effect on housing, education and the economics of African Americans in greater Kansas City. In 1948, two years before his death from a physical cancer, the Supreme Court in the Shelley Vs. Kraemer case struck down the racially restrictive housing covenants.</p><br>
                        
                        <p style="text-align: left">I moved to this community because I wanted the same thing that any other resident wants for their children, safety and education. But for nearly two decades I have been a resident of a city whose homes have these cancerous covenants and a climate of unwelcome. And while there are brief seasons the cancer is ignored as if it went into remission, horrific events like, the murder of Mr. George Floyd by law enforcement become a relapse with a vengence. </p><br>
                        
                        <p style="text-align: left">After attending a Kansas City, MO and Kansas City, KS rally together with Pastor Dennis Solis and his wife Sherri, Dennis had the ideal to do a Prairie Village rally to speak out against the injustice. He shared it with my wife Trudy and I who were eager to help organize the event. Trudy was instrumental in bring key leaders and students to the table and with the help of the adhoc team over 2,000 people attended. The sight was more beautiful than any building errected by J.C. Nichols. A city with an ugly history showed how beautiful it is when diverse people unite in sorrow, compassion and love to heal the cancer of racism and discrimination.</p>

								<h3>Educating our Citizens</h3>
								<p>Social justice education is learning and acknowledging the issues of racism and discrimination that impact our neighbors.  This enables us to see, listen and understand with empathy and compassion the value of our neighbor, their issues and what we can do, which will bridge the many divides that separate us.</p>

								<h3>Collaborating with Leaders</h3>
                                <p>We can learn from each other and accomplish more together.  The unarmed truth needs to be brought to those in leadership of the imbalance of power and inequities that bring the harm to our neighbors.  We must advocate for those oppressed over the drowning voices of an organization’s or local, state or national government’s bottom-line.</p>

                                <h3>Working for Systemic Change</h3>
								<p>We must work for systemic change because social justice education is not just about learning.  It is also about engaging in action to make the community around us more just and equitable.  We want all our neighbors to have access to fair opportunities. </p>

								<p>Stand Up organized a silent March and Rally Wednesday, June 10th, 2020 at 6:30 PM in Prairie Village, KS. Like so many others, our hearts grieved over the murder of George Floyd, and the injustices done to countless African Americans in our nation.
                                    
                                Our purpose is to acknowledge these injustices and to call ALL American citizens and American institutions to join in the hard work that will lead us to equality for everyone. With strong resolve, we must run to catch up with Justice.
                                    
                                We met-up at 6 PM at Shawnee Mission East High School, 7500 Mission Road in Prairie Village, KS in the front parking lot.  We began marching at 6:30 PM to Macy's parking lot in The Village, 4000 W. 71st Street.</p>

								<p>On Thursday, February 25th we held the city's first annual Black History Month Virtual Celebration. The city was outraged last summer with the murder of George Floyd and  did something about it by participating in a march for justice. We challenged our city to take another step towards justice by taking the Black History Month 50-minute challenge.  The challenge was to participate the Facebook Live event as a way to better know your Black neighbors and celebrate their achievements.  The program was a time of history, music, poetry and song with sharing from Mayor Eric Mikkelson of Prairie Village and Johnson County’s first Black Chief of Police, Byron Roberson.</p>

								<h3><a href="#">Planning an April 2021 Preparing for a Diverse City Training</a></h3>
								<p>How do you get ready for a city, state and nation that is becoming more diverse every day?  That is what we will answer in an upcoming training title, "Preparing for living in a diverse city."  Social justice education is part of our mission for educating citizens. Social justice education is learning and acknowledging the issues of racism and discrimination that impact our neighbors.  This enables us to see, listen and understand with empathy and compassion the value of our neighbor, their issues and what we can do, which will bridge the many divides that separate us.

								<h3><a href="#">Planning a June 2021 Juneteenth Celebration | March and Rally</a></h3>
								<p>Do you know about Juneteenth? Juneteenth is a holiday celebrated on June 19th to commemorate the emancipation of enslaved people in the US. The holiday was first celebrated in Texas, where on that date in 1865, in the aftermath of the Civil War, slaves were declared free under the terms of the 1862 Emancipation Proclamation. We will plan to recognize that day as well as the anniversary of the our June 2020 George Floyd silent march and rally  Please stay tuned.</p>

								<h3><a href="#">Hosted a September 2020 Forum on the Dividing Lines Tour</a></h3>
								<p>Trudy Williams gave us to idea for this event. STAND UP for Black Lives+ Prairie Village on Saturday, September 26, 2020 we invited residents to take the Dividing Lines tour:  A History of Segregation in Kansas City sponsored by the Johnson County Library.  This tour is free through the app Voicemap.  "Troost is a fairly well-known road in Kansas City, and it is kind of a dividing line between black and white and rich and poor."  The tour is designed so that you can safely drive through the city at your own pace while hearing stories about each area you travel through. We requested participants visit the Tour website for instructions and tour details, download the VoiceMap App and take the tour (90 mins - 2 hrs.) any time between 10am-2pm.  They were then asked join us for a live discussion on Zoom at 4:00pm hosted by Melissa Funaro (graduate of SME) and Dr. George Williams (father of 03, almost 4 graduates of SME) featuring Angel Tucker from the Johnson County Library.</p>

								<h3><a href="#">Hosted a November 2020 Forum on the Dividing Lines Tour</a></h3>
								<p>We had low participation for the first event so Dr. George Williams pushed to repeat the event with another featured speaker.  On Saturday, November 7th from 10 to 11 AM we hosted a "Stand Up: Dividing Lines Tour Forum" on Zoom.  High school parents and area students where invited to participate in this presentation and discussion.

								<h3><a href="#">The Justice Covenant</a></h3>
                                <iframe width="300" height="214" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7i6cdF6rNQk" frameborder="0" style="border:none"; allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
								<p>This concise statement expresses the essence of what we believe is the common ground of what it means for us to stand up together for justice.
                                    <br>
                                    1.	Racism is still a reality in our country.  Any community that is serious about diversity must educate itself about the historical impact racism has had on people of color. Only this kind of comprehensive understanding can help us see the gravity of the challenges we face as we work to diversify our community.
                                    <br>
                                    2.	Discrimination is not limited to color. Our primary focus is on the oppressive, unjust legacy of the racism that the African American (Black) community has endured, we also acknowledge and reject any discrimination experienced by someone because of their religion, ancestry, gender, sexual orientation, age or disability.  
                                    <br> 
                                    3.	The power of racism and discrimination is systemic.  We are committed to seeking justice in the systems that shape and impact our everyday lives. We will do this through non-violence, education, advocacy and activism.
                                    <br>
                                    4.	Justice demands that we face both our past and present failures.  We believe this kind of self-awareness will lead us to better reform, restitution, diversity and shared power.  It is true, we cannot change the past, but with the light from our past we can make today better.
                                    <br>
                                    5.	We will STAND Up together. While the goal of diversity is a good one, we also know it creates its own set of challenges.  Understanding this, our unity will be guided by the shared values of mutual respect, the innate dignity of every human being, and the belief in basic human rights for all. </p>

                                <h3>Black History: Black Trauma Black Triumph</h3><iframe width="300" height="214" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xDLhJsggRwc" frameborder="0" style="border:none"; allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

								<p>What is Black History Month? It is an annual celebration of achievements by African Americans and a time for recognizing their central role in U.S. history. This event grew out of “Negro History Week,” the brainchild of noted historian Carter G. Woodson and other prominent African Americans. Since 1976, every U.S. president has officially designated the month of February as Black History Month.</p>
                                <p>Why is this celebration necessary? I remember my high school American History class had a very thick textbook.  And yet in that textbook so few pages were devoted to Black history. There are many reasons why Black history is omitted but the end result is we are left out. And that’s why the celebration is needed.</p>
                                <p>Left out is the African American’s rich heritage in the continent of Africa, goodness of their humanity, the evil acts of their oppressors, the horror and depths of their suffering, the lack of reparations, the exploitation of their talents, their heroic perseverance and their major contributions that help make America great.  Dr. George Williams will share his poem, Black Trauma, Black Triumph, about the historic struggle and triumph of African Americans down through history.

								<h3><a href="#">Upcoming Preparing for a Diverse City Training</a></h3>
								<p>Sometimes knowing what a training is NOT ABOUT is just as important as knowing what a training is ABOUT.  The upcoming training has the benefit of following a host of other diversity training that has been developed and implemented which will allow us to improve on what has been less effective. The upcoming training is NOT ABOUT:
                                <br>
                                1.	Changing personal identity: asking participants to give up who they are or their love for their own cultural identity
                                <br>
                                2.	Defaming personal identity: participants feeling like the training presents their culture in an inferior or superior light
                                <br>
                                3.	Judging personal biases: participants are judged as “good or evil” based on the biases they may have toward other cultures
                                <br>
                                4.	Forcing the objectives: pressure the participants to change without consideration for their preferences
                                <br>    
                                5.	Checking off the diversity training box: Going through the motions of fulfilling a required training
                                The upcomaing trainning will be ABOUT:
                                1.	Growth: a chance to choose to see possible blind spots, different points-of-views and giving others the benefit of the doubt in trying to understand the culture of others
                                <br>
                                2.	Respect: making sure participants feel their culture is presented with equity on a level playing field with and attitude of inclusion that maintains dignity and respect
                                <br>
                                3.	Openness: expanding your knowledge and awareness of the culture of other people groups
                                <br>
                                4.	Understanding: knowing the origin of biases and what we can do to adjust our attitude and actions towards others
                                <br>
                                5.	Potential: releasing the full potential of the benefit of the diversity of thought, relationships and opportunities</p>
