  		<h3>Overview</h3>
                <p style="margin:10px;">
                Juneteenth! June 19, 1865 is the oldest nationally celebrated commemoration of the ending of slavery in the United States. On that date, months after the Civil War ended, Union General Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas and read General Order No. 3 informing the quarter of a million African Americans who were still slaves in Texas that they were free. That December, slavery in America was formally abolished with the adoption of the 13th Amendment. Juneteenth (June 19th), also referred to as “Freedom Day” has been celebrated by African Americans for the past 156 years and today we invite you and your children to celebrate our American history!
